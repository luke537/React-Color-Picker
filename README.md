# Colour Picker Interview Challenge by Luke Ryan

This repository contains code for a coding challenge I had to do for a frontend developer position

While the basic features such as colour generation and displaying the value of the clicked colour, there are some imperfections that I could not address due to time constraints.

For example:
1. There is a second input field for entering a new base colour that will then generate a new gradient. However, due to how React renders, it resets to the default base colour after a second. I just did not have time to fix this unfortunately.
2. The code could be tidier, there are a lot of inline styles and again due to time constraints I didn't arrange them into classes, ids and stylesheets.
